          Bloom collects your personal data, including but not limited to your

          Users may also provide additional personal information when creating
          their account. Please note that the amount of information you provide
          is voluntary, but providing less information might limit your access
          to certain features of the App. Users are responsible for protecting
          the personal information they submit on the App, including their
          passwords, to prevent unauthorized access to their accounts or
          identity theft. Only information that users are comfortable sharing
          with others should be uploaded to the App.

        <TextLayout num="4" title="Third-Party Service Providers">
          Bloom may use personal user data for website maintenance, upgrades,
          new releases, or analytics data review or compilation. We may share
          user information with third-party service providers engaged to assist

          Additionally, if Bloom participates in a merger, stock purchase, asset
          purchase, or other acquisition, user information may be shared with
          the purchaser or surviving entity. Bloom cooperates with government
          and law enforcement officials to enforce and comply with the law and
